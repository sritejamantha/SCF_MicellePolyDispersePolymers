This repository accompanies our codes to solve polymer self-consitent field theory(SCF) calculations to investigate micellization of polydisperse polymers. 
Results from this study are reported in our Physical Review Materials article published in 2019.

In this method we solve SCF equations in grand canonical ensemble and employ Schulz-Zimm construct to build polydisperse nature of polymers.
